Overall layout & navigation

Org selector (tabs or dropdown). Default = single org.

Tiered accordion: Function → Category → Subcategory.

Expand a subcategory to see its attribute table.

Filters (cross-functional)

Filter bar with: Org, Function, Category, Subcategory, Owner, Custodian.

Filters can be combined; update results without page reload.

(Optional) free-text search over attribute definitions.

Data shown in each subcategory panel

Header shows: Subcategory code/name, description, Change Summary, Implementation Examples, Owner(s), Custodian(s).

Attribute table (rows):

Maturity Level, Attribute #, Attribute Definition (baseline), 2024 Score (ro),

Status (Keep/Remove/Partial) — baseline rows only,

2025 Attestation (Meet/DoesNotMeet/Partial),

For custom rows: Custom Attribute #, Custom Definition, Custom Attestation.

Hidden but available for deep links/exports: CSF2 key (Ent_Subcat_Attr_CSF2) and CSF1 link (code + desc).

Owners/Custodians UI

Support multiple values; render as chips (e.g., “Alex Rivera”, “Ops Team”).

If many, show first few + “+N more” popover.

User actions

Inline edit Status and Attestation on baseline rows.

Add Attribute button per subcategory:

Form fields: Maturity Level (3/4), Attribute # (pre-filled placeholder e.g., 10, 20…), Definition, Attestation.

Submit adds a custom row at once.

(Optional later) edit owners/custodians via a small manager UI.

Immediate feedback

On save (status/attestation) or add custom:

Call write API → backend refreshes the single subcategory slice → UI refetches that subcategory → updated row appears immediately.

Show optimistic UI (spinner/check) and error toasts on failure.

“Final attribute view”

Toggle/view mode to show the final CSF-2 set (e.g., hide Status = Remove, include customs).

Expose CSF2 key for export/deep links (not shown in grid by default).

Performance

Lazy-load attributes only when a subcategory expands (fast initial render).

Virtualized rows if a subcategory has lots of attributes.

Pagination not required if virtualization is used.

Usability & polish

Tooltips/info icons for Function/Category/Subcategory descriptions, Change Summary, Implementation Examples.

Read-only styling for 2024 Score and baseline/custom columns as appropriate.

Row badges: “Baseline” vs “Custom”.

Highlight newly added/edited rows briefly.

Validation & rules

Attestation required when adding a custom attribute.

Status applies only to baseline rows (not customs).

Prevent duplicate (ML + Attribute #) within the same org/subcategory on the client.

Accessibility & UX

Keyboard-navigable table and dropdowns.

Clear empty states (“No attributes match your filters”).

Loading states per panel.
